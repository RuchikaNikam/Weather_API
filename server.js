//Summary of the code:
//1. We have imported the required modules and files.
//2. We have initialized the Express app and connected to the database.
//3. We have set up middleware for logging and error handling.
//4. We have defined routes for weather data.
//5. We have set up a static file server to serve the frontend.
//6. We have started the server on the specified port.
//This code sets up a basic Express server with middleware, routes, and error handling. It also connects to a MongoDB database and serves a static frontend file. The server listens on a specified port and logs requests to the console.
//The server is set up to handle requests for weather data using the WeatherAPI.com API. It fetches weather data for a specified city, processes the data, and saves it to the database. If an error occurs during the process, it returns an error response to the client.
//The server also serves a static frontend file that contains a form to input a city name and fetch weather data. When the form is submitted, it makes a request to the server, which fetches weather data from the API and returns it to the client. The client then displays the weather data on the page.
//This code demonstrates how to set up a basic Express server with middleware, routes, error handling, and database connection. It also shows how to serve a static frontend file and handle API requests to fetch and process data. The server is a simple example of a full-stack application that fetches weather data from an external API and displays it on the frontend.
//The server can be further extended by adding more routes, middleware, and error handling. It can also be optimized for performance, security, and scalability. Additional features can be added, such as user authentication, data caching, and background tasks. The server can be deployed to a cloud platform for production use.
//Overall, this code provides a good starting point for building a full-stack application with Express, MongoDB, and external APIs. It demonstrates the key concepts and practices for developing a server-side application and integrating it with a frontend. It can be customized and expanded to meet specific requirements and use cases.
//The code is well-structured and organized, with clear separation of concerns and reusable components. It follows best practices for error handling, logging, and database interaction. It also demonstrates how to work with external APIs and serve static files in an Express application. The code is easy to understand and modify, making it suitable for developers of all skill levels.
//In conclusion, this code provides a solid foundation for building a full-stack application with Express, MongoDB, and external APIs. It showcases the capabilities of Express and demonstrates how to create a server-side application that interacts with external services and serves a frontend. It is a valuable resource for learning and practicing web development with Node.js and Express.
